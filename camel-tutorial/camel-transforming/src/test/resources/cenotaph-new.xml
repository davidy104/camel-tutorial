		<bio_notes row="11">Brigadier Hargest was taken prisoner in the
			Bardia-Sollum area during the early stages of the Second Libyan
			Campaign. Most of the New Zealanders captured at this point were
			infantry and supporting elements whose positions had been overrun by
			German tanks. A warrant officer reported that the artillery were out
			of shells and that the supply line was cut. Captured by Germans, the
			prisoners were guarded by Italians. During the rest of the night [26
			November] 28 Battalion stood-to while Ravenstein Group streamed past,
			B Company searched for souvenirs over its own private battlefield, 23
			Battalion reorganised after its stiff fight, 22 Battalion on an
			escarpment near Bardia escaped attention, and Rommel prepared to go
			back to the Tobruk front as fast as possible. The next day Rommel
			began the return from Bardia to Tobruk, fell upon 5 Brigade
			Headquarters at Sidi Azeiz, and, after a one-sided action, captured
			it. (Cody 1956, p. 154)

		<bio_display row="1">Son of James and Mary Hargest, of
			Mandeville, Southland, and was educated at Gore and Mandeville
			schools. In 1917, he married Marie Henrietta Wilkie (22/48) (d1962),
			ARRC (Associate Royal Red Cross), who was the daughter of William
			Wilkie. They had three sons and a daughter – one son, Geoffrey Robert
			Hargest (447418) died of wounds in Italy in 1944 and another, Peter
			Miles Hargest (207275) died as the result of an accident while
			serving in Malaya nearly a decade later 1952. He served on the Land
			Board, Land Purchase Board, and Assessment Court. He was a member of
			the Southland Education Board from 1936, and Honorary A.D.C. to the
			Governor-General from 1925 to 1930. His political career began in
			1925, when he contested the Invercargill seat over several terms and
			represented the district in 1931, 1935, and 1938. He commanded the
			Southland Infantry Regiment and the 3rd New Zealand Infantry Brigade
			between World Wars I and II. He went on active service as Officer
			Commanding, 5th Infantry Brigade, with the 2nd New Zealand
			Expeditionary Force. Taken prisoner in November 1941, Hargest was
			held in Bardia for a week before being transferred one night, along
			with a large party of other senior officers, to Benghazi by
			submarine. Other officers who were taken by submarine went direct to
			Italy. He was later transferred to Sulmona (Italy) and finally to
			Campo PG 12 in the spring of 1942. It was from Campo PG 12 that he
			made his escape to Switzerland along with Brigadier R. Miles. There
			had been several unsuccessful attempts to escape from the villa by
			one or two of the officers in the spring and summer of 1942. Finally
			in September entry was gained to a disused and sealed-up chapel, from
			which a tunnel leading into the outer garden was begun. All the
			officers and other ranks in the camp assisted in some way in the
			tunnelling and other preparations for this attempt. On a wet evening
			- 29 March 1943 - the six men went out through the completed tunnel,
			and by 9.30 p.m. four were on their way to the railway station to
			catch a night train to Milan, and the two generals had set off to
			walk to the Swiss border. The latter and two of the others had the
			misfortune to be recaptured; but the two New Zealand brigadiers
			travelled by train to Como, and at half past ten on the evening
			following the break-out they crawled through the frontier wire near
			Chiasso into Switzerland.&quot; (Mason 1954, p. 213). In his book
			'Farewell Campo 12', Hargest describes his experiences from his
			capture on 27 November 1941 to his eventual escape. He disguised
			himself as a French railwayman in clothing adapted from articles
			available in the camp and, with a supply of goods saved up over
			several months, he and Brigadier R. Miles made their way to the Swiss
			border. After the invasion of France on 6 June 1944, arrangements
			began to be made for the repatriation of prisoners of war. James
			Hargest was appointed to command the New Zealand Reception Group in
			England. He took part in the D Day landing in Normandy as New Zealand
			observer and was killed in action on his last day in the field before
			taking command of the Prisoner of War Reception Group. The following
			extracts on Brigadier Hargest's wartime service were taken from the
			'N.Z.E.F. Times':. &quot;Another echo of the Balkan campaign and the
			part played in it by the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force is
			the announcement of awards His Majesty King George of Greece has been
			pleased to confer on several New Zealand officers, including
			Major-General B.C. Freyberg, V.C., D.S.O., etc., leader of the force
			and commander of the allied forces in Crete. One group, all senior
			officers, have been awarded the Greek Military Cross (Class A), and
			the other group the Greek Military Cross (Class C). Recipients of the
			higher award are Major-General B.C. Freyberg, Brigadier (now
			Major-General) E. Puttick, D.S.O., A.D.C. Brigadier R. Miles, D.S.O.,
			M.C., Brigadier J. Hargest, D.S.O., M.C., V.D., Brigadier H.E.
			Barrowclough, D.S.O., M.C., and Brigadier L.M. Inglis, M.C. The above
			awards were made at a ceremony at the main New Zealand base camp some
			time ago, the decorations being presented by the Greek Minister of
			War on behalf of His Majesty King of the Hellenes, and in the
			presence of a large attendance of officers and men. A guard of honour
			was provided by New Zealanders, led by the New Zealand camp pipe
			band. At the conclusion of the ceremony General Freyberg called for
			three cheers for the King of Greece.&quot; (from an article entitled
			'Balkan Campaign: Greek Awards to N.Z. Officers, Ceremony at Camp',
			NZEF Times, 20 October 1941, vol. 1, no. 17, p. 1). &quot;Wellington.
			— Warm praise for the men of 2 N.Z.E.F. is expressed in published
			letters received by the Prime Minister, Mr. Fraser, from Brigadiers
			J. Hargest and R. Miles, both of whom are prisoners-of-war in Italy.
			Referring to the battle in which they were captured, Brigadier
			Hargest says: 'We were not taken by surprise but were well warned and
			were only overwhelmed by sheer weight after all our guns had been
			destroyed. No man of ours left his place and I saw many acts of
			gallantry that, if I live to return, I hope to see rewarded. The only
			troops who moved were gallant men going forward to threatened spots.
			After it was over, after two hours, General Rommel congratulated me
			on the courage of our men. Major A. N. Grigg fell like a true hero. I
			would be grateful if you would tell the people of my unbounded
			admiration for their soldier relatives, who were never finer than
			when facing a hopeless situation or in the first sad hours of
			captivity.' Brigadier Miles also paid a tribute to his men, saying:
			'It is a source of pride to me, as I trust it may be a comfort to
			mourners, that all ranks of the artillery fought nobly and well. I am
			confident that their efforts and sacrifice, though at such a heavy
			cost, largely contributed to the success with which the Division
			withstood attacks from superior forces and was able to go on to
			eventual success.' Both Brigadiers and Bishop Gerard, Senior Chaplain
			to Forces, held a little Anzac service by themselves on April 25.
			They are in good health and are being treated well.” (from an article
			entitled '&quot;No Man Left His Place&quot; Brigadiers Hargest And
			Miles Write To Prime Minister', N.Z.E.F. Times, 14 September 1942,
			vol. 2, no. 64, p. 1). &quot;How he nearly shot up Rommel's
			headquarters, and later had a talk with the German commander, is told
			by Brigadier J. Hargest in an interview with the U.K. correspondent
			of the New Zealand Associated Press. Brigadier Hargest, who was taken
			prisoner at Sidi Aziez, near Bardia, in November, 1941, escaped from
			a prisoners-of-war camp in Italy and recently arrived in England. He
			was commanding the 5th New Zealand Brigade defending the Sidi Aziez
			airfield, which became an island when swamped by the German advance.
			In the midst of the stream of advancing panzers, nevertheless, the
			New Zealanders continued firing at the enemy, hitting tanks and
			trucks. Actually it was Rommel's headquarters which the brigade had
			encountered and Brigadier Hargest discovered this when he was taken
			prisoner. A British officer who was a prisoner in Rommel's
			headquarters said &quot;We were mighty glad when you stopped firing.
			It was extremely hot.&quot;. Brigadier Hargest's &quot;island&quot;
			had no chance against the advancing Germans, who shelled it to pieces
			then overran it with tanks. One tank came at the brigadier with its
			guns pointing straight towards him. He said to himself: 'I'm hanged
			if I am going to put up my hands.' &quot;I shoved them in my pockets
			and just stood there. At the last moment the tank sheered off from me
			and went straight over a slit trench in which were two of my men, but
			they were not harmed. &quot;. Enemy Praise: Brigadier Hargest was
			eventually taken prisoner by General Kramer, who was most generous in
			his praise of the way in which the New Zealanders had fought. The
			enemy treated him with punctilious politeness and asked him to retain
			his revolver but when General Kramer was not looking it was quickly
			whipped off him by a soldier. Later Brigadier Hargest was taken to
			see Marshal Rommel. He entered the tent thinking, 'I'm hanged if I am
			going to salute this fellow', so he just bowed stiffly from the waist
			towards Rommel. The German commander was cold and austere and he did
			not like this. Through an interpreter, he told Brigadier Hargest that
			he expected him to salute. Brigadier Hargest replied, &quot;I do not
			salute enemy officers. I only salute superior officers of my own
			army. &quot;. Rommel then said, &quot;Your men fight well&quot;, to
			which Brigadier Hargest replied, &quot;Yes, but your tanks were too
			much for us.&quot; Rommel said, &quot;But you have tanks&quot;, and
			Brigadier Hargest replied, &quot;Yes, but not here.&quot; Rommel then
			said, &quot;Perhaps then my men are better after all. &quot; (from an
			article entitled 'Brigadier Hargest's Experiences: Interview With
			Rommel – Escape From P.W. Camp', N.Z.E.F. Times, 17 January 1944,
			vol. 3, no. 134, p. 8). &quot;Wanganui.— A meeting with Brigadier J.
			Hargest in London was described by a Wanganui soldier writing home.
			&quot;I had lunch a few days ago with Brig. Hargest who to my mind is
			this war's premier escapee, &quot; wrote the soldier. &quot;It is a
			wonderful effort from one of his years and rank. He could have sat
			back in comfort in a general’s prison. He is extraordinarily well,
			and is still the same courteous, calm, and cheerful brigadier for
			whom we have so much respect. &quot; (from an article entitled
			&quot;War’s Premier Escapee&quot;, N.Z.E.F. Times, 14 February 1944,
			vol. 3, no. 138, p. 1). &quot;Their Majesties talked with Brigadier
			R.S. Park, Group-Capt. A.J. Manson and Mr. S.R. Skinner, and when the
			King saw Brigadier Hargest he made straight for him and continued the
			conversation begun two days previously at the Buckingham Palace
			investiture at which the Brigadier received awards. Both their
			Majesties seemed particularly interested to hear more of how he
			escaped. &quot;We knew you had arrived in England safely,&quot; the
			Queen told Brigadier Hargest, no doubt having read newspaper
			accounts.&quot; (from an article entitled 'King and Queen Visit
			London Forces Club', N.Z.E.F. Times, 6 March 1944, vol. 3, no. 141,
			p. 2). &quot;London.— Extracts are now available from Brigadier
			Hargest’s speech to a private meeting of the Royal Empire Society, at
			which Sir Alexander Godley presided. Referring to Crete the Brigadier
			said: &quot;I thought I had seen severe bombardments, but I have
			never seen anything to equal the bombardments the enemy gave us
			before sending in his gliders and parachutists. When he stopped the
			bombardment and sent in his airborne troops, I don’t think we had a
			single soul alive in that sector. I lost 70 per cent of my brigade,
			but I still believe that if we had had air support we could have held
			Crete. The governing factor was in the lack of air cover for our
			ships.&quot;. Speaking of his imprisonment in Italy, the brigadier
			said that he was sent to Salerno, in the Abruzzi country. &quot;Only
			recently I had a letter from my own son saying he was just one ridge
			of country removed from my old home, &quot; he continued, &quot;Later
			we went to Florence and lived in a castle there. There were 14 senior
			officers and 15 men. We decided that as soon as we got ourselves
			organised we would endeavour to escape. We decided to make a military
			operation of it and to dig our way out of the castle.&quot;. Escape:
			&quot; It took us five months&quot;, Brigadier Hargest went on.
			&quot;We began by collecting what money we could and such food as
			chocolate. We cut up army blankets for clothes and made a cap and
			jacket for each of us. I dyed my trousers with a bottle of ink and a
			tin of blacking. Five of us dug our way down through the castle
			chapel, which we used as a place to keep our stores. We dug down 10
			feet, then under the length of the room, the battlements, an area of
			enclosed ground, and up again outside it. It was very solid ground,
			being nearly all rock, and the only tools we had were a kitchen knife
			and bars of iron which we used as levers, but we eventually worked
			our way out. We shored up the hole so that no unsuspecting Italian
			should fall in and then waited for a stormy night in order to deceive
			the sentries, whom we believed would stay in their boxes. We
			eventually got the right kind of night. The sentries were inactive
			and we got out.&quot; After seven months in Switzerland, Brigadier
			Hargest made his way to Spain. Morale in France: &quot;Of my travels
			through France I must not say much&quot;, the Brigadier carried on.
			&quot;I have been a bit critical of the people of France since the
			occupation, especially after having heard that they had become
			apathetic and defeatist. Germany was giving that out all over the
			world and the Italian papers were full of the apathy of the French.
			That is not true to-day. There is a stirring in France to-day such as
			has occurred in few countries at any time. I was helped by hundreds
			of people, most of whom had not the slightest idea who I was or what
			I was about, but they knew I was a refugee. All classes – rich, poor,
			the very humblest working classes, servant girls – every one of them
			had the power to hand me over for a good reward to the enemy, but I
			don’t believe it ever entered their minds. Once or twice I had to go
			into houses in a great hurry and ask them to help us. There was no
			question about that. They just said - we will take the risk . To-day
			in France, there are thousands upon thousands of young men who have
			given up their homes after having been called up for forced labour in
			Germany, but instead of going to Germany they have taken to the
			mountains. They are doing their best to hold the positions until the
			Allied armies come. Meantime they go down to the railways and
			sabotage trains. I was greatly moved by the way the French were
			carrying on and were prepared to carry on in the hope that they would
			have some share in the redemption of their country. We know that
			there are a great number of Vichyites and that a great number of the
			young people have been poisoned by German propaganda into becoming
			members of the militia. But that is not France. The main body of
			France is waiting for its chance. I am hoping that we British people
			will give them that chance and once they get their freedom, will help
			them to their feet. Brigadier Hargest received the CBE and two Bars
			to his DSO from His Majesty the King at a recent investiture at
			Buckingham Palace.&quot; (from an article entitled 'Brigadier's
			Escape and Experiences in France', N.Z.E.F. Times, 6 March 1944, vol.
			3, no. 141, p. 5). &quot;Wellington.— Brigadier J. Hargest has been
			wounded in Normandy, according to official advice received by his
			wife. It was stated that his injuries consisted of multiple wounds on
			the head and left shoulder, but these were superficial and Brigadier
			Hargest had returned to duty. He was temporarily attached to a famous
			British division, with which he went to Normandy.&quot; (from an
			article entitled 'Brigadier Hargest Wounded', N.Z.E.F. Times, 10 July
			1944, vol. 4, no. 159, p. 4). &quot;The death in action in France of
			Brigadier James Hargest, DSO, MC, 2 NZEF, was reported in an agency
			message from London during the week. It will be recalled that the
			late Brigadier Hargest was Member of Parliament for Awarua. Captured
			in the action near Bardia in the 1941 desert campaign, he was taken
			to a prison camp in Italy, but subsequently managed to escape to
			Switzerland. Later, he made his way across France to Spain, from
			whence he returned to England. It was earlier reported that the
			Brigadier was serving in Normandy with a famous British formation and
			that he had suffered superficial wounds in action.&quot; (N.Z.E.F.
			Times, 28 August 1944, vol. 4, no. 166, p. 4). &quot;London.— An
			organization is being established in England to deal with repatriated
			prisoners of war when they arrive in this country from Germany after
			the Armistice. New Zealand soldiers will be administered by 2 NZEF
			(United Kingdom) reception group, which was to have been under the
			command of the late Brigadier Hargest, with Lieut-Col. L.F. Rudd
			second in command.&quot; (from an article entitled 'Preparations in
			England for Repatriated POW's', N.Z.E.F. Times, 25 September 1944,
			vol. 4, no. 170, p. 7)Freyberg's Circus':. In Egypt Freyberg
			commanded the Second New Zealand Expeditionary force (2 NZEF) as part
			of the British Eighth Army. The major part of the 2NZEF was the
			Second New Zealand Division, numbering some 20,000 men and 2800
			vehicles, tanks and guns. New Zealand suffered a number of defeats in
			fighting the Afrikakorps. In November 1941, New Zealand opened the
			way to Tobruk in days of confused desert fighting at Sidi Rezegh and
			Belhamed. At heavy cost, New Zealand held Rommel's advance into Egypt
			in 1942 at the battles of Minqar Qaim, Ruweisat Ridge, and El Mrier.
			Finally under Montgomery New Zealand found a British general who knew
			how to win. The allies defeated Rommel at Alam Halfa and El Alamein
			in October 1942. The tide turned and the allies advanced from Egypt
			through Libya into Tunisia, fighting numerous bitter encounters. The
			final battle was at Enfidaville below the heights of Takrouna. It was
			followed by the surrender of the German and Italian forces in Tunisia
			on 13 May 1943. ('Scars on the Heart' exhibition, Auckland War

			gallantry and devotion to duty. He fought his battery until the enemy
			were within 500 yards, and his ammunition exhausted, at the same time
			rallying infantry stragglers and manning a fire trench, then made a
			reconnaissance into a wood sending back valuable information. He was
			finally wounded by rifle fire at close range.&quot; (London Gazette,
			26 July 1918)
			DSO Bar citation: &quot;Escape from Camp 12, P.M. 3200,
			Italy (General's
			Camp). This camp was extremely well guarded and in
			consequence it was
			decided that the only possible method of escape
			would be by way of a
			tunnel. n the 18th September, 1942, tunnelling
			began. All officers
			and other ranks worked, with the exception of one
			officer who was
			awaiting repatriation.
			The entrance to the tunnel was
			through a sealed up chapel which all soil
			was placed. The work, which
			consisted of a 3 foot by 3 foot tunnel,
			40 feet long with a 10 foot
			shaft at the entrance and a 7 foot shaft
			at the exit, was completed by
			the end of February 1943.
			At 2100 hours on the 29th March, 1943,
			Brigadiers Miles and Hargest, in
			company with four other officers,
			escaped through the tunnel. The
			four other officers were subsequently
			recaptured. Brigadiers Miles
			and Hargest dressed as workmen and having
			walked to Florence station,
			caught a train to Milan where they went to
			the North station. They
			caught a train to Como and walked towards
			Chiasso. 2 kilometres from
			Chiasso they left the main road and
			proceeded across country until
			they reached a knoll south of Chiasso
			where the frontier lay along
			the opposite slope of a valley below
			them. The frontier consisted of
			heavy cyclone netting 12 foot high
			interlaced with brambles and with
			small bells near the top. They cut
			the wire with pliers at ground
			level without making much noise and
			came on to Swiss territory at 220
			hours on the 30th March, 1943. They
			gave themselves up to the police
			at Mendrisio and were released in
			Berne on the 2nd April, 1943.&quot;
